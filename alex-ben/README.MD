# BLOG PROJECT

**Author**: Benjamin Hurst, Alexander Stone
**Version**: 1.4.0

## Overview
This is a blog app that allows the user to upload articles to a website for other people to read. You can sort through articles by author and category.

## Getting Started
Open index.html in any modern browser.

## Architecture
This app uses Javascript with ES6, HTML5,CSS3, Jquery 3+, and the Handlebars JS library to build itself. It is an app that contains the entire blog on one page and makes heavy use of Handlebars and Jquery to minimize the effort required to modifiy the HTML.


## Change Log
Implemented Handelbars templating.
Added helper functions for Handlebars.
Rewrote our DOM rendering functions to use the templates.
Rewrote as many fucnctions as possible to arrow functions.
Used handelbar templates to populate the filter template.
